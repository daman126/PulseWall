# Power Plan

This document describes how PulseWall is powered and how power usage is managed during operation.

---

## Power Source

PulseWall is powered using a standard 5V USB wall adapter.  
Power is supplied directly to the Raspberry Pi Pico W through its USB port.

This allows the device to remain always-on without the need for batteries or charging circuitry.

## Display Power Considerations

An e-ink display is used because it retains its image without requiring constant power.

- Power is primarily consumed during screen refreshes
- Static content does not consume power once drawn
- This makes the display well-suited for an always-on wall device

---

## System Operation

- The Pico W runs continuously while powered
- Screen updates occur only when:
  - The user changes screens
  - New weather or calendar data is fetched
  - The system returns to the home screen after inactivity
- Timekeeping is handled locally without constant screen refreshes

## Update Frequency

To avoid unnecessary power usage and network activity:

- Weather data is updated periodically (e.g. every 30–60 minutes)
- Calendar data is updated on boot and periodically afterward
- Screen refre
